## About the build

Hi guys thanks for the taking the time to go through my tech test,
I went with a simple Laravel build I didn't see much need for Javascript, as for the database I was considering making it more complicated for scalability but I notice it's meant to be a prototype, so too early for multiple tables with varying user permissions etc, I did wonder if it's more optimal to include a field to store the target % or to do the calculation,

On the styling front there's not much I can do with a table, I've simplified the target column and am using colours
to signify if the targets met for mobile as well as removing some text, also I just used vanilla css, bootstrap and tailwind have default table styling but if I used that there'd be less for me to demonstrate, fi you want an example I recently did a front end focused tech test https://github.com/L3wy3/Alt-TT it's TALL stack and is probably a better demonstration of my responsive abilties
